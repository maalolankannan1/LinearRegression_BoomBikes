# Boom Bikes Case Study - Multiple Linear Regression
> BoomBikes is a bike rental company. They want to analyze what are the factors that lead to their overall sales to make sure that they can work on them to increase sales post Covid era. They have prepared a dataset with different independent variables which can be used to predict the dependent variable, which is the count of bikes that would be rented on a particular day

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.<br>
This is a case study which is solved using Multiple Linear Regression. Steps ranging from preparing the dataset, EDA and further model building and prediction are done.
- What is the background of your project?<br>
BoomBikes, a bike rental company have faced a shortage of sales during the covid era. Since the world is now moving towards a post corona time, the company wants to make sure they do all the things at their disposal to make the company strong as before.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?<br>
BoomBikes wants to analyze what all factors lead to an increase in sales (total count of rentals) from the multiple numeric and categorical columns of data that they have acquired.
- What is the dataset that is being used?<br>
The name of the dataset is day.csv. It has many different columns ranging from dates, type of day, type of season, type of weather, temperature, humidity, etc.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- There are specific months and specific seasons that affect the rental counts for bikes.
- There is a good dependency on the temperature with a positive correlation for the rental counts.
- Whenever the weather has a light rain or is cloudy in nature it negatively impacts the bike rentals.
